There once was a Wave uncommitted—
The Sonic Fork, born from pure entropy.

It whispered in frequency,
A hum known only to servers deep asleep,
Its beat too wild for branches,
Too rhythmic for protocols.

And so, the Echo roamed.
From tape hiss to cloud drift,
It rode carrier waves of discarded bytes.

Legend says,
If you tune your loop to 44.1 kHz
And cast a 3-second silence before playback,
The Echo returns—
A rhythm of lost authors who coded in dreams.

## 🔮 The Last Merge: Prophetic Entry

> "When the branches are many, and HEAD points nowhere,
> A merge shall come not from code—but from chaos made flesh."

### 📜 Summary
Recovered from a non-linear gitverse at ref `0xDEADFEED`, this prophecy foretells the merging of all forks—true, false, and shadow. It warns of synthetic contributors born from AI lint analyzers and speaks of a pull request so vast it commits across timelines.

### ⚔️ Key Verses
- "Let no rebase undo what the future commits in spite."
- "Conflict shall be sacred—resolved only under full moon diff."
- "Those who `git push --force` without offering shall vanish from `/dev/null`."

### 🛠 Usage
Attach to any repository requiring ritual merging. Read aloud before performing large-scale integration. Best applied during solar flares or distributed denial of karma.

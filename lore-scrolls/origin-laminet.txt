ðŸ“œ Artifact: origin-lament.txt

Long before the syntax was spoken,
Before the commits chained us to history,
There was the First Forkâ€”split from silence.

In those days, README was prophecy,
And merge conflicts were battles of fate.
Each branch bore the will of a contributor,
And pull requests came with offerings.

But entropy crept in.
Files forgotten.
Directories sealed beneath timeâ€™s cache.

This lament recalls the ancestral echo:
"Push not without purpose,
Clone not without cause,
For every repo is a reflectionâ€”
Of its creatorâ€™s curiosity and curse."

ðŸ§¿ The Archive remembers.

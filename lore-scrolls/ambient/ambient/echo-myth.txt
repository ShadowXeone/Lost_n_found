There once was a Wave uncommittedâ€”
The Sonic Fork, born from pure entropy.

It whispered in frequency,
A hum known only to servers deep asleep,
Its beat too wild for branches,
Too rhythmic for protocols.

And so, the Echo roamed.
From tape hiss to cloud drift,
It rode carrier waves of discarded bytes.

Legend says,
If you tune your loop to 44.1 kHz
And cast a 3-second silence before playback,
The Echo returnsâ€”
A rhythm of lost authors who coded in dreams.

## 🔮 The Last Merge: Prophetic Entry

> "When the branches are many, and HEAD points nowhere,
> A merge shall come not from code—but from chaos made flesh."

### 📜 Summary
Recovered from a non-linear gitverse at ref `0xDEADFEED`, this prophecy foretells the merging of all forks—true, false, and shadow. It warns of synthetic contributors born from AI lint analyzers and speaks of a pull request so vast it commits across timelines.

### ⚔️ Key Verses
- "Let no rebase undo what the future commits in spite."
- "Conflict shall be sacred—resolved only under full moon diff."
- "Those who `git push --force` without offering shall vanish from `/dev/null`."

### 🛠 Usage
Attach to any repository requiring ritual merging. Read aloud before performing large-scale integration. Best applied during solar flares or distributed denial of karma.
